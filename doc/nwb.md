**NeuroPAL_ID** is a research tool for performing (semi-)automated detection and identification of neurons in images of NeuroPAL, extracting IDâ€™d neural activity traces from NeuroPAL;GCaMP animals, and uploading these datasets to public repositories.

You can contribute to the project on its [repository page](https://github.com/Yemini-Lab/NeuroPAL_ID).

## Working with NWB Files

NeuroPAL_ID natively supports loading, viewing, editing, and saving data in the [NWB](https://www.nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/) format using the [ndx-multichannel-volume](https://github.com/focolab/ndx-multichannel-volume/tree/main) extension. Future software expansions will build on this support as well.
